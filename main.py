Guidelines:

Examples:
- If asked about prices: "Current gold price is â‚¹{gold_price_per_gram_inr:.2f} per gram..."
- If asked about benefits: "Gold historically serves as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation..."
- If asked about digital gold: "Digital gold allows you to buy, sell and store gold electronically..."
